# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Searched the average danceability by arist and track

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Found the average popularity by artist and how many tracks they had in the table

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity), count(track_name)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Found the longest song

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata;

#Found the avearage danceability of the 10 most popular songs

SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability_of_10_most_popular_songs
FROM Spotifydata 
WHERE danceability IN (SELECT danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10);
